This is a basic GitHub guide.

The "master" is the main branch.
It contains committed files.
If someone else made changes to the "master" branch while you were working on your branch, you could pull in those updates.

Use "branching" to make changes before committing to "master".
A new branch is called "feature".
After final edits, it's committed to the main branch.

A saved change is called a "commit".
An associated message called a "commit change" explains the change.
"Commit changes" captures the history of your changes.
